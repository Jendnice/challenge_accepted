_Challenge Accepted_ gives kids and young teens a fun and easy way to make a positive impact on the world. Through “powers” reminiscent of Captain Planet, and modern day “challenges”, kids can positively impact different facets of our environment, and those who inhabit it.

## Getting started

To get started with the app, fork and clone this repo. In the root directory of the project, install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install
```

Next, migrate and seed the database:

```
$ rake db:migrate
$ rake db:seed
```

Navigate to the _client_ folder and run:

To start the backend in a local server, from the root directory, run:

```
$ rails server
```

To start the frontend in a local server, from the _client_ directory, run:
