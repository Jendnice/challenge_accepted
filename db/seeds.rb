# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)






# Seed data framework ready below. 
# Just add in remaining info and you can run 'rake db:seed' to populate seed data:


# Power.create([{
#     name: "Earth",
#     description: "",
#     info: ""
# },
# {
#     name: "Wind",
#     description: "",
#     info: ""
# }])



# Challenge.create([{
#     name: "Befriend the Lorax",
#     description: "",
#     completed: false,
#     power_id: 1
# },
# {
#     name: "",
#     description: "",
#     completed: false,
#     power_id: 2
# },
# {
#     name: "",
#     description: "",
#     completed: false,
#     power_id: 1
# }])
